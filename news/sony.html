        <p>
            After going big in the premium segment last year, OnePlus is now planning to disrupt the entry and mid-levels of the television market like never before. The company is all set to jump into the market with affordable smart TVs that it hopes could help it get a serious foothold in the lucrative TV market in India.
            <br>
OnePlus has already announced that it will be launching two new range of smart television series in this attempt. The new smart TVs will be launched on July 2, with the entry-level series teased to start at a price that'll be quite a bit cheaper than the premium OnePlus TV Q1.
<br>
Ahead of its launch, there's little that's known about the device in terms of specifications and features. Yet, there still is enough to get us excited. Here's everything we know about the new OnePlus TVs so far.
<br><br>
<b> OnePlus TV: Expected price</b>
<br><br>
Continuing on the price, the new OnePlus TVs have already been teased to come in two different series with the company already teasing the price of the entry-level device for the first one. In a recent tweet shared via its twitter account, OnePlus all but gave away the pricing of the entry variant model by hinting that it will start retail for less than Rs 20,000.

While not an accurate price, but it is still a good enough hint that the TV series could start retail at a very competitive price of Rs 39,999. Apart from this, it hasn't revealed anything about the more expensive series yet, however, even that is expected to not cross the Rs 40k barrier and as such come fighting in the space that companies such as Xiaomi, Vu and TCL already operate in.
<br><br>
<b>New mid-range smart TV</b> <br> <br>
This is something that the company has already confirmed multiple times, and something that was also repeated during an exclusive interview with India Today Tech. While the buzz is around the aggressively priced entry-level smart TV that will retail below the Rs 20,000 mark, OnePlus will also be bringing a mid-range TV that could be priced as low as Rs 35,000 but will most likely start retail for Rs 40,000.
<br>
This mid-range TV will get better specs than the entry-level TV and may also see the cross over of some premium technologies and features that were earlier seen on the OnePlus TV Q1.
<br> <br>
<b>To launch in two sizes</b>
<br> <br>
While there is no official word on this, the new OnePlus TVs could be made available in two different models with 32-inch and 43-inch display sizes. This information is based on a recent listing on Bluetooth SIG which showed two upcoming OnePlus LED TV variants with model numbers 32HA0A00 and 43FA0A00.
<br>
This would make a lot of sense considering the new OnePlus TVs will starts at an entry-level price point which is usually populated with 32-inch panel TVs, and will go up to the mid-range segment which maxes out with TVs with 43 and 50-inch panels.
